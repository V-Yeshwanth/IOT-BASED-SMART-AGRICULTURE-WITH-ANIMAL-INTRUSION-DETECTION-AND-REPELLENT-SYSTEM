# IOT-BASED-SMART-AGRICULTURE-WITH-ANIMAL-INTRUSION-DETECTION-AND-REPELLENT-SYSTEM
This proposed system monitors continuously in detection of animal intrusion and taking appropriate action which enables reduction of crop damage.
Depending on the level of the soil moisture and weather forecast, the proposed system can be used to turn the water and growth promoterâ€™s sprinkler ON/OFF, thereby making the process easier to use.
Therefore, the proposed system can grow the crop securely without human intervention.
